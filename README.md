Hi, I’m @AnomanderRK based on a novel fiction character that I really love. My real name is Kenny Miranda

I’m interested in python code, data science and statistics and right now
I’m currently focussing on how to get better at python so I'm putting all my efforts in creating a better portfolio

In case you wanna collaborate, we can talk on [linkedln](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenny-miranda-aa3215133/)
 and this is my personal [blog](https://the-learning-journey.com/)
